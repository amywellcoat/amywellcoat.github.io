        <p class="grey-text text-darken-1"> As part of our HND Art & Design course at Fife College, we were commissioned
            by NHS Fife to create art pieces that represented the vast Industrial Heritage of Fife. I chose to study the
            Salt Mining Industry as salt was Scotland's third largest export in the 1970s. As I researched into the
            industry, I discovered that salt was mined very close to where I live so I was able to carry out in-depth
            first hand research.</p>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-1"> I had recently created 3D artwork not long before this project, and as the
            brief was very open I decided to experiment further with this technique. By collaging a range of mediums
            such as papers, marbling, watercolours, acrylic and embroidery, I recreated the Salt Pans and Windmill
            located in St Monans, East Fife. As there was not too much evidence of what the machinery looked like by the
            time the site was abandoned in 1823, I decided to focus on the landscape of the location and what what we
            see today.</p>
        <p class="grey-text text-darken-1"> The perspective focuses on the old windmill which powered the mines, the
            ruins of the salt pans and the unique bumps they have left behind in the terrain. Not forgetting the view of
            the River Forth, looking out into the horizon. The range of mixed medias add texture to the colourful scenery,
            and many parts of the piece are raised by 3D foam, adding dramatic and realistic depth to the painterly
            landscape.</p>
