I have created this website that you are currently viewing using HTML and the Materialize CSS library. The aim was to create a space online where I could neatly display my portfolio, information about myself, provide links to my socials and contact information all in one place.

I chose to use the Materialize CSS library because the components are modern and complimentary to my style. The design language was nice to work with as it allowed me to include unique effects such as hoverable buttons and drop down menus whilst keeping a consistent style with the rest of the website on a range of different devices. After some amendments, I finalised the UX and layout of my content to be easy to look at and navigate around, taking into account the different needs for desktop and mobile viewing. This language helped me learn a lot about the basic concepts of HTML coding and allowed me to design a personalised space online for everything I do.

Changes to the website are version controlled using GitHub which is useful as it allows me to access and revert to any past versions if I need to, and I can keep track of every change that I make as it organises the information of each amendment.
